<b>Fun Fierce Flow</b><br/><i>Style: </i>Vinyasa Flow<br /><i>Level: </i>2-3<br /><i>Teacher:</i>Noah MazÃ©<br /><br /><div class="grayline"></div><br />This vinyasa class begins with seated pranayama to establish the breath, sun salutation progressions to build heat and focus, into strong standing pose flows to work the legs and stretch the spine, hand balancings and core work for fierce fun, and backbends as the night cap. Enjoy!<br />
