# Some documentation

Just trying to get yogaglo videos on xbmc.

## Categories for finding videos

Per the yg site, their are 4 categories on their homepage navigation banner.

* Teachers
* Style
* Duration
* Level

These 4 categories should be in the plugin index.  Each of these categories parses the homepage to find their respective entries and list them in the next view.  THeer are no videos to choose from until you further filter your selection inside the chosen categories contents (i.e. particular teacher, style, level or duration)

## Yoga of the day
A 5th category is some 'yoga of the day'.  The homepage lists 6 different videos every few days.  They always some theme/title and a description.  I call it 'yoga of the day'.  This entry should be displayed in the index menu in the plugin.  But unlike the other 4 categories that allow a further selection, this should take you straight to choosing the videos.

**Note: yoga of the day videos have no date associated with them, for whatever reason**

# Yoga glo class information

All the classes items from the site carry thin information, return as a dictionary in the code.
